Welcome to the W3C Web Machine Learning Working Group!

The group just launched - stay tuned for more information on how the group will operate.

Per our charter, the work will happen in collaboration with the Web Machine Learning Community Group where the work has been incubating:

Once a critical mass of participants have joined the group, we will organize the first official teleconference of the Working Group, and figure a path towards a First Public Working Draft of the proposed WebNN API:

All participants are required to follow the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct:
